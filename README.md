#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client Artemis Financial is a financial company that was looking to have software developed for them to send encrypted information from a sever to a client and visa versa. 
#What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing? One thing that I did well was my ability to identify vulnerabilities and other security issues. I was then able to bring these issues up to the client and develop a strategy to minimize these risks or completely nullify them.
#What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I think one of the most challenging things at first was reading the vulnerability report and learning how to digest the information. After spending quite some time on the report and learning about each line item, I was able to accurately identify issues and develop solutions. 
#How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
One approach I took to increase the layers of security was to build in security checks at the most vulnerable components. For example, with user input and scrubbing this input for malicious intentions, sanitizing data that was received from a 3rd party api, or ensuring the encrypted data that was received was accurate and matched the porivded security keys. 
#How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
One way that I checked to see if I included a new vulneravility was by running a vulnerability report on the refactored code. Once I was able to run the report I reviewed it for any changes from the previous report and addressed those concerns. 
#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A helpful resource for me is Stack Overflow and being able to read discussions that have taken place around similar issues for me. From there, I was able to learn how to handle a challenge and correct it. 
#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
One thing that I would like to demonstrate is my ability to analyze data, find a pattern or vulnerability and then how to design a solution that will be secure.
